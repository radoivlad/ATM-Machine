# ATM-Machine (installation guide below)

Hello and welcome to ATM-Machine! :)

An interactive console resembling an ATM machine, allowing for account creation and accessing different options with regards to an account.

I have built this project having the final course of First Steps in Programming Java (IT Factory course) as my starting point and inspiration.

The interactive menu offers 3 possibilities:
1. User can create their own account;
2. User can access the ATM machine using their configured PIN number;
3. User can simply have a trial run on the ATM machine, with a preset test account;

The ATM Machine can be operated for displaying account balance, depositing or withdrawing funds.

Any errors that may occur with wrong input given to the console, either format (ex: improper menu options, double values for depositing/withdrawing, name etc.) or invalid operation (ex: withdrawal exceeding current balance), will be handled accordingly. A corresponding message will be printed to the console, as to reintroduce valid input.

The user can switch between multiple menu variants, in accordance to desired output: main menu, create new account, operate ATM options, validate account PIN for accessing ATM.
