# ATM-Machine (installation guide below)

Hello and welcome to ATM-Machine! :)

An interactive console resembling an ATM machine, allowing for account creation and accessing different options with regards to an account.

I have built this project having the final course of First Steps in Programming Java (IT Factory course) as my starting point and inspiration.

The interactive menu offers 3 possibilities:
1. User can create their own account;
2. User can access the ATM machine using their configured PIN number;
3. User can simply have a trial run on the ATM machine, with a preset test account;

The ATM Machine can be operated for displaying account balance, depositing or withdrawing funds.
