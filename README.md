# ATM-Machine (installation guide below)

Hello and welcome to ATM-Machine! :)

An interactive console resembling an ATM machine, allowing for account creation and accessing different options with regards to an account.

I have built this project having the final course of First Steps in Programming Java (IT Factory course) as my starting point and inspiration.

The interactive menu offers 3 possibilities:
1. User can create their own account;
2. User can access the ATM machine using their configured PIN number (within a maximum of 3 allowed failed attempts);
3. User can simply have a trial run on the ATM machine, with a preset test account (default balance: 10.000);

The ATM Machine can be operated for displaying account balance, depositing, withdrawing funds or returning to the main menu. Informative messages will be displayed throughout program execution, including by Logger object.

Any errors that may occur with wrong input given to the console, either format (ex: improper menu options, double values for depositing/withdrawing, name etc.) or invalid operation (ex: withdrawal exceeding current balance), will be handled accordingly. A corresponding message will be printed to the console, as to reintroduce valid input.

The user can switch between multiple menu variants, in accordance to desired output: main menu, create new account, operate ATM options, validate account PIN for accessing ATM.
